# Rethinking Decentralisation

####Rachel Ryans

In late 2016 was invited my Mozilla’s OpenIOT Studio to think about Decentralisation, particularly in rural environments.
But first let’s start from the basics…

**_Who I am and what I’m interested in_**

I’m a creative technologist. I come from an arts background, I’m self taught techie who has always been interested in how things work. I’m a really good google-until-I-find-the-solution maker.I believe anyone can make things with the right guides and enough confidence.
I worked within a technology charity over 3 years. Within this role I got to travel the world attending conferences and festivals where people discussed new technology and the power of making. I also designed and ran workshops, outreach and longer form educational programmes. I returned to the freelance world in 2016 to have the opportunity to take part in projects like this one.
I also make tech with The Pi Hut, particularly focusing on making add-on boards for people new to making. Our aim is for our boards to do one thing well.

Before all this I ran a Arts and Tech venue in Norwich called Soup Lab.
Some things I’m generally interested in right now:
+ a friendly framework/language to talk about IoT with non-techies
+ making IoT things with non-techies
+ why/how/is the internet important to people with low/no connectivity
+ does IoT widen the divide between those with good connectivity and those without (if so, how do we deal with this?)

Why? Because if we want to make tech for everyone, then we need to include them in the progress.

**_Talking about IoT & decentralisation_**

Within this project I will be discussing IoT and decentralisation with people who have no experience of making technology, and perhaps little experience using it. Before embarking on any project that involves participants of different skills and backgrounds it’s useful to reflect on the language we use. Using too much technical jargon in the initial stages of the discussion is a sure-fire way of alienating half your new team. We want to build confidence and skills, so we don’t want to dumb down the discussion, but with a little time and effort we can develop a narrative that leaves everyone feeling like they know what’s actually being discussed.
Sidenote: it can also help your technically skilled members of the team be reminded that we are talking about how the technology affects people, rather than the technology itself. Impact rather than solutions.
