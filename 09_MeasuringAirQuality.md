# Measuring Air Quality Through Our Subjective Experience 

#### Ling Tan

What can we do about pollution? Itâ€™s such a large issue that we often feel disempowered because it seems like nothing any of us does on our own will have any effect. 

At the beginning of the year, I have been working on an experimental project, WearAQ that looked at how school children could make sense of these complex issue and to consider how people might combine their subjective perception and intuition with wearable technology and machine learning algorithms to investigate air quality issues. I hosted workshops and exploration walks with students at the Marner Primary school in Tower Hamlets London to go out into the surrounding neighbourhood, measure air quality both technologically and through their own perceptions, and recorded their subjective experience using low tech wearable devices that catalogued their gestures. The perceptual data were then used:

+ *Experiment 1:* to contrast and correlate with measurements from mobile pollution monitoring equipment and photos taken by students on their environment during the walk
+ *Experiment 2:* as ground truth data that are compared with predicted perception data created from conducting data science and machine learning experiments by using existing public data sources found on platforms such as London Air Quality Network and OrganiCity Urban Data Observatory to pinpoint specific datasets that could affect the AQ in the identified journeys
