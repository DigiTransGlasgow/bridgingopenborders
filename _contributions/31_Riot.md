Using facial recognition technology the installation determines your emotional reaction to a riot scenario.

You are confronted by a riot police office. Respond with fear and the film goes in one direction..respond with aggression it goes in another.

This prototype is an emotional responsive, live action film installation utilising a 3D ambisonic soundscape.

The RIOT (prototype) was honoured as part of the Digital Dozen Break Throughs in Storytelling 2016. Where Columbia DSL acknowledged the most innovative approaches to Narrative from the past year from around the world in the industries of art, entertainment, journalism and marketing.

The system uses facial recognition and artificial intelligence to determine your emotional state and subsequent navigate you through a personalised riot experience. The narrative responds in real time through machine learning software to alter the trajectory of the film. RIOT currently measures 3 states: anger, calm and fear. The portable prototype consists of a central computer, large screen, camera and an 8 speaker array.

The objective of the prototype was to evaluate proof of concept, build the artificial intelligence and machine learning systems and extend this powerful narrative into a modern day user experience.

The RIOT prototype has been exhibited at **the Museum of Modern Art Peru**, [The Future of Storytelling Festival NY](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/R232BhnA6Vhv), The Festival of the Mind Sheffield and **The Phi Centre Canada**. The project went on to be featured by global broadcasters ranging from **CBS**,  [Guardian](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/v0v0BfKY28t5), [NBC](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/n161BcWvRbC6) to [The New York Times](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/1ZVZBsbeV1T2) etc. Speaking engagements regarding RIOT have included [Tedx Australia](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/VdDdBhx8e7sX) at the Sydney Opera House, **The Google Cultural Institute Paris**, as part of their **Art and Machine Learning Global Summit**. **Games for Change Festival** NY, **Mutek Festival** Canada. [CPH:DOX](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/5RzRBhk876iE) under the theme, [Art, Technology & Change](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/gLKLBhz4wbTz) to name a few.

This next stage of the RIOT installation will be exhibited at the **V&A Museum** and **The Future of Storytelling** Festival 2017. Karen Palmer will also be a speaker at the **Future of Storytelling Summit NY** talking on the theme of Storytelling as Activism: Changing the participantâ€™s Perception. She will also be Artist in Residence at **Thought Works** NY September-December 2017 where she will continue to develop RIOT.

When I started the journey to develop RIOT two years ago it was a born out of a response to police brutality in America on African Americans and the riots spawned from that! The global theme of social unrest now resonates far beyond specific minority groups. The social climate has shifted dramatically, making this a significant and relevant story of this time which now resonates with most people.

After a highly successful pilot phase we are now seeking development and finance and partners for the full scale RIOT experience.

**How it works**

The digital experience is an installation that uses branching video scenarios triggered by bespoke facial recognition software and machine learning software written by researchers at the cutting edge of human machine interface technology.

Neuro-scientific principles and artificial intelligence are the foundation of the user engagement, formulated into an immersive digital media experience, being both technical and scientific innovative. 
RIOT combines machine learning technology and creative innovation, integrating software platforms into a receptive storytelling experience in which the player's emotional state is the remote-control for the story. 

The RIOT digital experience enables a self awareness experience through tech and storytelling, to enhance the players cognitive skills through a unique multi-sensory experience.

**Full Scale RIOT development**

A rebuild of the AI Facial Recognition technology to register more emotions with greater accuracy.

For the full scale RIOT, audiences will be fully immersed in a life size 360 film installation: a volatile world of looting, burnt -out shops, activists, anarchists and intimidating  riot police officers on horseback and tear gas.
High Production values, compelling cinematography and explosive sound design will create a sense of scale and chaos enveloping the audience in a dramatic adrenaline pumping experience.

Additional gaming mechanics and user experiences to aid the flow of the story.

Extensive neuropsychology and behavioural psychology research with a central focus on racial bias. Develop impact strategy and distribution models.
