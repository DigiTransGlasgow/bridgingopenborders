# Making voice visible

## Or why we should investigate the  anatomy of AI and networked devices

#### Vladan Joler

We, as the human particle of networked society, are visible in almost every moment of interaction with technology. We are constantly being tracked, quantified, analysed and commodified. But in contrast to our hyper visibility, many of the phases of birth, life and death of networked devices are covered with a cloak of invisibility. With emerging popular devices relying on a centralised AI infrastructure and invisible interfaces such as voice for example, it seems that the cloak of invisibility is growing even bigger.

We have reached a point where the smooth and shiny aluminium surface of our devices is screwless, without visible entrance, we have lost the keyboards allowing us to code and create new worlds. And now we are losing visible interfaces that will be replaced with voice or gesture interfaces. With the so called “cloud” and machine learning technologies computing and processing does not happen within our devices anymore, but in some big gray building thousands of kilometers away. The actual devices, processing software and algorithms are  somewhere else, or possibly on many places at the same time, but rarely within our reach. What we have for example in devices such as Amazon Echo is just a few sensors and speakers. Not a lot to own on the user’s side, not a lot to open, brake, fix or remix.

**Many layers of invisibility**

As is the case with networked devices we can also speak about various other layers of invisibility:

+ Invisibility of the network infrastructure and the so called cloud infrastructure;
+ Invisibility of the production process, supply chains and materials being used in production;
+ Invisibility of human labour related to many processes in the production of devices;
+ Invisibility of the code hidden behind proprietary software;
+ Invisibility of the overall energy consumption of the whole system.

And many other obvious or more subtle forms of invisibility that we have already related to networked devices. There are some forms of invisibility that are specific and emerging when we speak about voice interfaces as an extension to AI and machine learning infrastructures in comparison to the network infrastructure that we have investigated in our previous work.

On one hand, at the front we have basically invisible interfaces, but then,  deeper at the level of the heart of the process, in the darkness of the neural networks and machine learning, we are seeing new forms of invisibility. Invisibility of the process of machine deduction itself. In previous years in academic, policy and activist circles there was a discourse related to the importance of algorithmic transparency. We can't say that some clear solution emerged from those discussions; and the problem of algorithmic transparency is still very much on the table. But, if we speak about machine learning algorithms, that are responsible for models behind voice interfaces for example, we are facing potentially even deeper problem.
